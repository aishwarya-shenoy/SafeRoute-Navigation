# Introduction
While recent developments in urban transportation, such as Google Maps, have prioritized reducing travel
time to a destination and providing accurate estimates on route duration across various modes of transportation,
they continue to overlook potential safety hazards
and crash-prone areas within cities, raising concerns
among commuters and policymakers alike.
The goal of this project is to address these challenges
by analyzing traffic data and identifying accident-prone
areas of the city in order to equip users with the safest
routes to their destinations.
Our methodology, which incorporates real-time data
on traffic flow, weather conditions, and road infrastructure,
will benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including
users, transportation authorities, policymakers, and
government bodies. A safer transportation system reduces
accidents and congestion,ultimately benefiting
everyone who uses the transportation infrastructure.
Additionally, government bodies will gain valuable insights
into unsafe areas within the city, enabling them to
prioritize infrastructure improvements and road safety
initiatives effectively.
